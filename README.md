# AISearch
Implementation of BFS, DFS, A* and UCS Search for CSCI 561 (Fundamentals of AI) at USC

There are 4 Search Algorithms that have been implemented here.

1. Breadth First Search
2. Depth First Search
3. Uniform Cost Search
4. A* Search.

The algorithms have been implemented keeping in mind the input format specification. 

#Input Format

Start State 
Goal State
Number of Traffic Lines
Live Traffic Line Data
Number of Sunday Traffic (Heuristic Data)
Heuristic Data.

#Output Format
